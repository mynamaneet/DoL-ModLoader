# DoL-ModLoader
A DoL Modloader that'll allow players to use multiple different mods that changes the source code of DoL. Usually you can only run one content mod at a time because it's compiled into an HTML file, but hopefully with this modloader multiple mods can be loaded at once. I'm using Java for it and at this point it'll probably take about a month for me to get a testable version done(hopefully).
